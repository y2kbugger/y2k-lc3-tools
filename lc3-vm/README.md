# Virtual Machine for LC-3 assembly

This is implementation of own virtual machine (VM) for LC-3 assembly language in `python`, inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-vm).

`Little Computer 3`, or `LC-3` is an assembly educational low-level programming language.

`obj/` directory contains obj files that can be run to test VM.

## Requirements

No dependencies, just pure `python 3`.

## Running the VM

```
./vm.py obj/2048.obj
# C-c to close
```
